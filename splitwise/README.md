# Splitwise Low Level Design - Interview Solution

## üìã Problem Statement

Design a system like **Splitwise** that allows users to split expenses among friends and track who owes whom.

## üéØ Core Requirements Covered

### Functional Requirements
- ‚úÖ Add users to the system
- ‚úÖ Add expenses with different split types (Equal, Exact, Percent)
- ‚úÖ Track balances between users
- ‚úÖ Settle debts between users
- ‚úÖ Show individual and overall balances

### Non-Functional Requirements
- ‚úÖ Clean, maintainable code structure
- ‚úÖ Extensible design for new split types
- ‚úÖ Efficient balance calculations
- ‚úÖ Input validation and error handling

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Class Hierarchy
```
ExpenseManager (Main Controller)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ User (User Management)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Expense (Expense Representation)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Split (Abstract Base)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ EqualSplit
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ExactSplit
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ PercentSplit
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SplitCalculator (Business Logic)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ BalanceManager (Balance Tracking)
```

### Key Design Patterns Used
1. **Strategy Pattern**: Different split calculation strategies
2. **Factory Pattern**: Can be extended for split creation
3. **Single Responsibility**: Each class has one clear purpose
4. **Open/Closed Principle**: Easy to add new split types

## üîÑ System Flow

1. **User Registration**: Add users to the system
2. **Expense Addition**: Create expense with split details
3. **Split Calculation**: Calculate individual amounts based on split type
4. **Balance Update**: Update who owes whom
5. **Settlement**: Users can pay each other to settle debts

## üí° Interview Discussion Points

### 1. **Scalability Considerations**
- **Current**: In-memory storage
- **Production**: Would use database (PostgreSQL/MySQL)
- **Caching**: Redis for frequently accessed balances
- **Microservices**: Split into User Service, Expense Service, Balance Service

### 2. **Database Schema Design**
```sql
Users: user_id, name, email, created_at
Expenses: expense_id, amount, paid_by_user_id, description, created_at
ExpenseSplits: expense_id, user_id, amount, split_type
Balances: from_user_id, to_user_id, amount
```

### 3. **Additional Features to Discuss**
- **Groups**: Multiple friend groups
- **Categories**: Food, Travel, Entertainment
- **Recurring Expenses**: Monthly rent splits
- **Currency Support**: Multi-currency handling
- **Notifications**: Email/SMS for new expenses
- **Mobile App**: REST API design

### 4. **Edge Cases Handled**
- Floating point precision in calculations
- Self-payments (user paying for themselves)
- Negative amounts validation
- Percentage splits not adding to 100%
- Exact splits not matching total amount

## üöÄ How to Run

```python
# Run the demo
python splitwise_lld.py

# Expected output shows:
# 1. Equal split example
# 2. Exact split example  
# 3. Settlement process
# 4. User-specific balances
```

## üß™ Test Scenarios

### Test Case 1: Equal Split
- 3 users, $120 dinner, paid by Alice
- Expected: Bob owes Alice $40, Charlie owes Alice $40

### Test Case 2: Exact Split
- 3 users, $100 shopping, paid by Bob
- Alice: $40, Bob: $25, Charlie: $35
- Expected: Alice owes Bob $40, Charlie owes Bob $35

### Test Case 3: Settlement
- Bob pays Alice $40
- Expected: Bob's debt to Alice reduces/eliminates

## üìä Complexity Analysis

| Operation | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|
| Add User | O(1) | O(1) |
| Add Expense | O(n) | O(n) |
| Calculate Split | O(n) | O(1) |
| Show Balances | O(n) | O(1) |
| Settle Payment | O(1) | O(1) |

Where n = number of users in the expense

## üîß Extensions for Advanced Interview

### 1. **Simplify Debts Algorithm**
```python
# Minimize number of transactions
# Instead of: A->B $10, B->C $10
# Optimize to: A->C $10
```

### 2. **Group Management**
```python
class Group:
    def __init__(self, group_id, name, members):
        self.group_id = group_id
        self.name = name
        self.members = members  # List of User objects
```

### 3. **Expense Categories**
```python
class ExpenseCategory(Enum):
    FOOD = "FOOD"
    TRAVEL = "TRAVEL"
    ENTERTAINMENT = "ENTERTAINMENT"
    UTILITIES = "UTILITIES"
```

### 4. **REST API Endpoints**
```python
# Potential API design
POST /users                    # Create user
POST /expenses                 # Add expense
GET /users/{id}/balances      # Get user balances
POST /settlements             # Settle payment
GET /users/{id}/expenses      # Get user expenses
```

## üé§ Interview Presentation Tips

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic classes and requirements
2. **Build Incrementally**: Add features one by one
3. **Explain Design Choices**: Why abstract Split class?
4. **Handle Edge Cases**: Show validation logic
5. **Discuss Improvements**: Database, API, scaling
6. **Time Management**: Core features first, extensions later

## üîç Follow-up Questions to Prepare For

1. **How would you handle concurrent updates to balances?**
   - Database transactions, optimistic locking

2. **How to handle different currencies?**
   - Currency field in Expense, exchange rate service

3. **How to optimize for read-heavy workload?**
   - Caching, read replicas, denormalized balance tables

4. **How to ensure data consistency?**
   - ACID transactions, event sourcing for audit trail

5. **How to handle very large friend groups?**
   - Pagination, batch processing, async calculations
